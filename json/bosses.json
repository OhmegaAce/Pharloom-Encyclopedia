        "in-game events": "The Bell Beast is initially found in The Marrow, where she is trapped in Silk. Once the Bell Beast is freed using the Silkspear skill, she attacks Hornet. After her defeat, the Bell Beast allows Hornet to ride her and acts as the game's fast travel system. The Bell Beast also drops the first Silk Heart which takes Hornet into a Silk dream when she collects it. Upon waking, Hornet is now on the station platform next to the ready and waiting Bell Beast. In Act 3 upon reaching any Bellway, the Bell Beast is missing from their station and a hole is open where they would normally reside. Hornet can enter this hole and drop into the Bellways where she then fights the Bell Eater. Upon defeating the Bell Eater, the Bell Beast returns to deliver the final blow before Hornet returns back to the station. It is then revealed that the Bell Beast is now a mother and has a litter of Beastlings. From them Hornet learns the Beastling Call which can be played on her Needolin on any stable surface to summon Beastlings to take her directly to whichever Bellway station the Bell Beast is presently at.",
