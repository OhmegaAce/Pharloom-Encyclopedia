                        As a bartender, Creige offers his service and sells his Nectar drink for 10, which upon
                        purchasing
                        will fully heal Hornet and give some silk.

                        After defeating Widow and releasing the residents of Bellhart, a Wish from Creige will appear on
                        the
                        Wishwall in Bellhart. Talking with Creige reveals that the Halfway Home is constantly troubled
                        by
                        the Craws flying above, and that he wishes to build a scarecrow to scare the Craws away. Creige
                        then
                        tasks Hornet with collecting 25 Ragpelts from killing the Crawbugs (dropped from Craw, Tallcraw
                        and
                        Squatcraw). After giving the rags to Creige and returning to Halfway Home some time later, a
                        giant
                        Scarecrow is put on top Halfway Home and the Craws that used to fly around will be gone.

                        Creige will also offer the Vintage Nectar for 480 during the Great Taste of Pharloom wish. Upon
                        purchasing it, Hornet must retrieve it from Creige's basement, where she must first complete an
                        arena fight with various Skarr enemies.

                        If Hornet is afflicted with the Cursed Crest, Criege will not offer Hornet a drink, and instead
                        insist she go visit Yarnaby to the northwest.

                    <p>
                        Forge Daughter resides in Deep Docks, where she was sent on order from the Citadel to provide
                        her
                        services to that area. She and Ballow are the only inhabitants of Deep Docks to be unaffected by
                        the Haunting.

                        Forge Daughter aids Hornet in her journey by providing a smithing service to craft Hornet's new
                        Tools.

                        She is a hulking being and, much like the rest of the inhabitants of the Deep Docks, seems to be
                        comprised of bells; a small sleigh bell for her head and a large church bell making up her body.
                        She
                        also refers to herself using the royal we (plural pronouns, usually used by royalty symbolising
                        a
                        connection to divinity), though the reason for this is currently unknown.

                        The metal carapace filled with hot coals that she appears to be tinkering on can be found all
                        over
                        the Deep Docks. Their purpose is also unknown.

                        later escape by himself sometime in Act 1, before Hornet visits The Slab.

                        If Hornet returns to Grindle's prison after freeing him but before proceeding to Deep Docks, he
                        can
                        be found at the bottom of the room looting bags on the floor. When prompted, he will sell hints

                    During Act 3, Grindle will sell various unique goods if their original merchant has died as long as
                    that
                    item is not found near that merchant's corpse.

                        Inside a cave behind a breakable wall in Greymoor, Kratt is found trapped in silk beside his
                        carriage. After Hornet breaks the silk and frees him, he mentions wanting to reward Hornet with
                        something inside his carriage, and leaves to join the Flea Caravan.

                        Regardless of whether the Flea Caravan is at The Marrow or Greymoor, the next time Hornet sees
                        the
                        Flea Caravan, Kratt will be there with his metal carriage. Upon speaking, he offers his hot spa
                        service to Hornet for 10. Should Hornet accept, the carriage next to Kratt will open its door
                        for
                        Hornet to enter.

                        Inside the carriage is a pool of hot water; standing in the water will gradually regenerate
                        Hornet's
                        health and Silk to full. After being in the spa for a few seconds, Kratt will make noises and
                        slowly
                        rise up to peek through a window at the top of the carriage, spying on Hornet in the bath, at
                        which
                        point Hornet can jump up and hit him. After exiting the carriage, if Hornet hit Kratt, he will
                        apologize and claim he was only doing "repairs" and not spying on her, before offering to let
                        her
                        use the spa free of charge. Visiting him again, Kratt will mention that Hornet is now a
                        "treasured
                        guest".

                        If Hornet doesn't punish Kratt for peeping, she will have to pay the 10 fee again to unlock the
                        spa's door.

                        After joining the Flea Caravan, Kratt will travel with them wherever Fleamaster Mooshka leads
                        them
                        next.

                    <p>The dice minigame can be initiated by talking to Lumble the Lucky after exhausting his initial
                        encounter dialogue. Winning all of Lumble's Rosaries causes him to gift the Magnetite Dice to
                        Hornet.

                        Lumble owns 40 Rosaries when he is first encountered. He will gain 4 every time he wins the dice
                        minigame. In order to exhaust Lumble's Rosaries, Hornet must win all of his originally owned
                        Rosaries in addition to any Rosaries he gained from winning the game. If Hornet wins again after
                        exhausting Lumble's Rosaries, he will give her the Magnetite Dice.

                        If the Magnetite Dice were not won from him, Lumble is found dead once the Cogwork Dancers are
                        defeated or the Clawline is acquired and the Magnetite Dice can be obtained from his body. If
                        the
                        dice were won from him, his body will otherwise be found in the room before the Last Judge boss
                        room. However, if the dice aren't picked up by the time Act 3 begins, they will be sold at
                        Grindle's
                        shop in Blasted Steps for 300, after he presumably loots Lumble's corpse.</p>

                        Mort resides in a bug-shaped building with a locked front door, featuring a toll booth which
                        costs
                        30 for each entry. The entry fee also grants access to a Bench inside the shop. The door
                        re-locks
                        itself when Hornet moves away from the building. A cogwheel on the inside of the door can be hit
                        while the door is open, breaking the locking mechanism and skipping future tolls entirely.

                        If the gate on the east side of Pilgrim's Rest is unlocked, allowing the Rhinogrund to escape,
                        and
                        the mechanism on the door of Mort's building has been broken, a subsequent event will occur.
                        Upon
                        revisiting Pilgrim's Rest after traveling elsewhere, loud noises can be heard coming from inside
                        Mort's building. Entering the building reveals the Rhinogrund is ramming a table that Mort is
                        crouching behind for safety. After Hornet defeats the creature, Mort laments that pilgrims like
                        himself are being tested and tormented for no reasons.


                    <h4>Mort's corpse</h4>
                    After entering Act 3, the building can be found crushed with debris beside the bench, the door open
                    and Mort nowhere to be found. Any unpurchased unique items he sells are moved to either Grindle's
                    shop or on his corpse, in an alcove to the southwest of Pilgrim's Rest.

                    <p>
                        Twelfth Architect is an Architect built by the Citadel to serve Pharloom by creating mechanical
                        tools. They are the only Architect still functional within the Citadel. The Architects
                        learned some of their skill from the Weavers.

                        Twelfth Architect is old and beginning to shut down due to their advanced age. They appear
                        to be overriding their original directive with some of their own feelings and opinions.

                        the Ruined Tool in Weavenest Murglin, they can convert it into the Silkshot.

                        After collecting 25 Tools, Twelfth Architect will sell the Architect's Key, which unlocks the
                        Chapel of the Architect.

                        After all of Twelfth Architect's items have been bought and Hornet has acquired the Architect's
                        Melody, talking with the Twelfth Architect will reveal that their final time is coming. Later
                        they will be found motionless at their desk, and a Pristine Core can be collected from their
                        shell, implying that they have taken their own life by ripping the Core out of their metallic
                        shell.

                    <p>
                        Vaultkeeper Cardinius is a Vaultkeeper of the Citadel. The Vaultkeepers were tasked with
                        collecting and storing knowledge and history of the Citadel. Their authority in Pharloom was
                        second only to the Weavers.

                        Vaultkeeper Cardinius is the only Vaultkeeper who still retains their faculties.

                        They are a large, long-bodied bug with multiple limbs and a conical helmet. They are found in a
                        chamber leading off of the tall central room in Whispering Vaults.
                    </p>
                    <h3>In-Game Events</h3>
                    <p>
                        Upon first entering Cardinius' room, parts of their body are visible and sounds of them
                        shuffling around can be heard. They will not appear to Hornet unless a Psalm Cylinder is in the
                        inventory. Upon entering the listening room, they confront Hornet and demand she hand over the
                        Psalm Cylinder. After handing it over, Cardinius claims Hornet's kind are supposed to be dead,
                        but begrudgingly repays her for handing over the cylinder.

                        After this, Cardinius will pay 200 for Psalm Cylinders, or 320 for the Sacred Cylinder, and can
                        play their recordings by highlighting them and pressing ATTACK in the menu.

                        Once all cylinders are given to Cardinius, they will celebrate their complete collection and
                        conclude their agreement with Hornet. Cardinius will still permit Hornet to peruse the
                        collection and listen to the Cylinders' recordings.

                        Later, they will send a Gramophone to Bellhart which is sold by Frey. Using this, Hornet can
                        listen to the full collection in her Bellhome.

                        enlist
                        their help in the boss battle.

                        The duo can also appear in Sinner's Road in the long room right above where you can find
                        Disgraced
                        Chef Lugoli, having beaten a Roachkeeper (permanently preventing that enemy from spawning).

                        In the Choral Chambers, Garmond and Zaza will sometimes appear to help fight enemies in hallway
                        rooms. Once the shortcut to the roof above the Whispering Vaults is opened, Garmond can be met
                        there
                        and will offer to engage in a friendly duel with Hornet. If he is defeated, he can be
                        encountered
                        again in High Halls outside the Forum, and will offer to help Hornet do battle inside.

                        After Hornet has acquired the Threefold Melody and completed the Fine Pins wish, Garmond and
                        Zaza
                        can be found resting at Songclave and will no longer ask to duel.

                        During Act 3, Garmond and Zaza can be found in various areas on the path up to the Citadel (Far
                        Fields, Greymoor, Sinner’s Road, Shellwood). Sitting at a Bench after an
                        encounter will cause them to become available to find in another location. After three
                        encounters
                        with them, they will stop appearing and the Hero's Call wish will become active in Bellhart.

                        After defeating the Savage Beastfly, she can be found next to the only Bench in Hunter's March.

                        Gilly disguises herself as a bush, and can only be spoken to after her hiding place is
                        discovered. While in disguise, she will sometimes sneeze or make other sounds that may give away

                    <p>
                        Second Sentinel is the second of the five known automatons built by the Citadel to protect its
                        pilgrims.

                        The clockwork sentinels were built by the Architects long ago and were tasked with bringing
                        bugs safely into the Citadel, possibly by force.
                    </p>
                    <h3>In-Game Events</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hornet can activate Second Sentinel after finding 3 Cogheart Pieces and placing the assembled
                        Cogheart in their body in the Cogwork Core. After their activation, Second Sentinel chooses to
                        continue protecting the Citadel. They can then occasionally be found fighting enemies at
                        various locations within the Citadel.

                        After helping Second Sentinel defeat two hordes of enemies (both encounters being in Choral
                        Chambers, one next to Songclave, the other being in the long corridor north of
                        Whiteward)[Missing reference] and retrieving the Conductor's Melody, the Final Audience Wish
                        will appear in Songclave, resulting in Hornet fighting Second Sentinel in High Halls. Upon their
                        defeat, they give the Reserve Bind.

                        In Act 3, Second Sentinel can be found and spoken to in the room to the left of Grand Bellway
                        station, and in High Halls.

                    <p>
                        Sherma is an optimistic pilgrim on the path to the Citadel. He wields a chime, which he uses on
                        several occasions, while singing. He is occasionally seen near Benches or certain settlements,
                        accompanying Hornet on her journey to the Citadel during Act 1, and aiding fellow pilgrims at
                        Songclave for the majority of Act 2 and Act 3.

                        Sherma is always very positive and likes to sing, he is also very friendly. During the game, he
                        refers to Hornet as "red maiden", and Hornet seems to begin to care for him due to his innocence
                        and lack of combat prowess, though he begins to become less naive later in the game, especially
                        in Act 3.

                        Sherma is first seen in The Marrow, where he is singing to a door in an attempt to open it. He
                        will then appear before where the Bell Beast is trapped and sing for it.

                        He appears later on in the Far Fields, Blasted Steps and Choral Chambers. He later stays in
                        Songclave.

                        During the Balm for the Wounded wish, Sherma travels to Whiteward, where he hopes to find
                        healing supplies to aid his fellow pilgrims in Songclave. He becomes trapped when the way back
                        collapses, and must be rescued by Hornet. After his rescue, he gives Hornet a Spool Fragment
                        before making his own way back to Songclave.

                        In Act 3, he becomes the new Caretaker of Songclave and the First Shrine, replacing the old one,
                        and donning the Caretaker's attire.

                        After his defeat, Seth appears in Greymoor, revealing he survived his battle with Hornet. He has
                        seemingly lost his memory and does not recognise Hornet. He says that he is now travelling
                        Pharloom. He can be next found in Shellwood, east of the Bellway, and then the Grand Gate, just
                        outside the entrance to the Citadel. The final appearance in the Grand Gate can be skipped if
                        the Everbloom has been obtained.

                        Once the Everbloom has been obtained, Seth will take his final resting spot in the Festival of
                        the Flea if it has started. Seth holds the highest score out of the NPCs in all 3 of the Flea
                        games, and beating his high score in each game grants the Guardian's Memento.

                        that it's time for the Flea Caravan to move on, and once again asks Hornet to join them. If
                        Hornet accepts, she will travel with the Flea Caravan and arrives at the Last Judge's room at
                        Blasted Steps. He then gifts Hornet a Spool Fragment for helping them thus far.

                        Fleamaster Mooshka then waits for more fleas to join the Caravan. After at least 22 Fleas have
                        returned and the Pale Lake at the edge of Putrified Ducts has been discovered, Hornet can inform
                        Fleamaster Mooshka of its location, prompting the Flea Caravan to move to it. Hornet can also
                        choose to join them in this journey once again. This is the final resting stop of the Caravan
                        and is called Fleatopia.

                        After finding all the lost Fleas, Fleamaster Mooshka will give Hornet the Egg of Flealia as a
                        reward.

                        In Act 3, Fleamaster Mooshka and the residents of Fleatopia prepare for the end of times by
                        hosting the Festival of the Flea as a way to celebrate a final time before the world is consumed
                        by Void. Upon getting the highest score in all 3 of the festival's minigames, thus completing
                        the Ecstasy of the End wish, Hornet will receive a Pale Oil as a reward.

                        Through the process of the Silk and Soul Wish, the Caretaker directs Hornet to consult the
                        Chapel Maid and Bell Hermit to assemble the trap that ensnares Grand Mother Silk at the end of
                        Act 2. Unbeknownst to Hornet, this trap uses the power of The Abyss, causing the Void to spread
                        along Silk's strands to damage and corrupt the entirety of Pharloom. Hornet later finds and
                        confronts the trio, who are revealed to be Snail Shamans, holding them partially responsible for
                        the destruction caused by the Void and obtains their assistance in freeing Pharloom.

                        When Hornet seeks the Everbloom that would let her survive the depths of the Abyss, the Snail
                        Shamans teach her the Elegy of the Deep and send her on a quest to claim the Old Hearts of
                        Pharloom that empower a spell that lets Hornet dive into her own memories to claim the flower.
                        When Hornet returns with the flower in hand, the Snail Shamans have disappeared, only leaving
                        their Soul-filled shells behind.

                        consists of a race on three tracks, each increasing in difficulty and offering different rewards
                        for winning them.

                        The first reward is a Rosary Necklace, the second is a Beast Shard, and the third is a Mask

                        Beast is freed using the Silkspear skill, she attacks Hornet. After her defeat, the Bell Beast
                        allows Hornet to ride her and acts as the game's fast travel system.

                        The Bell Beast also drops the first Silk Heart which takes Hornet into a Silk dream when she
                        collects it. Upon waking, Hornet is now on the station platform next to the ready and waiting
                        Bell Beast.

                        In Act 3 upon reaching any Bellway, the Bell Beast is missing from their station and a hole is
                        open where they would normally reside. Hornet can enter this hole and drop into the Bellways
                        where she then fights the Bell Eater. Upon defeating the Bell Eater, the Bell Beast returns to
                        deliver the final blow before Hornet returns back to the station. It is then revealed that the
                        Bell Beast is now a mother and has a litter of Beastlings. From them Hornet learns the Beastling
                        Call which can be played on her Needolin on any stable surface to summon Beastlings to take her
                        directly to whichever Bellway station the Bell Beast is presently at.

                        Forum, it is possible he was originally responsible for the entire choir in the High Halls or
                        beyond. He is sickly, hidden in a hospital-like covered bed with a machine threading Silk
                        inside, likely keeping him alive. The Conductors seem to undergo some form of intensive surgery
                        to sustain themselves.

                        Hornet encounters Conductor Ballador after fighting a gauntlet of enemies in The Forum. He
                        expresses regret that the Citadel has grown so hostile and unwelcoming, and offers his weakened
                        melody as a small comfort.

                        After beating the Cogwork Dancers and starting the Learn: Conductor’s Melody Wish, Hornet may

                        Although Pondcatcher Reed is a resident of Bellhart, they do not seem to have their own
                        Bellhome. Instead, they can be found either wandering the streets of Bellhart, or making their
                        way to or from Shellwood.

                        suspended in the air with silk threads. After Widow is defeated, Pondcatcher Reed and the other
                        residents are released and they return to the their normal functions.

                        Red Memory, as an area, consists of multiple platforming sections. During the entire time there,
                        Hornet uses attacks from the Hunter Crest, regardless of which crest is equipped in the
                        overworld.

                        In the first memory, a child Hornet is shown practicing silk powers surrounded by multiple
                        Weavers. The Weavers urge her to do so, in order so that she may prove herself "more Weaver than
                        Wyrm".

                        In the second memory, Herrah the Beast speaks to her daughter, still a child at the time,
                        telling her to ignore "their whispers"; likely those of the Weavers who wanted to use Hornet for
                        their own goals to supplant the Monarch of Pharloom. Herrah then tells Hornet to look beyond
                        these desires of others who wish to shape Hornet's future, and only then she may find "another
                        hope".

                        In the third, Hive queen Vespa fights and trains Hornet.

                        Lastly, Hornet meets with the White Lady, who gives her the Everbloom.

                        Skarrsinger Karmelita is the song queen and the most talented warrior of the Skarr tribe, using
                        her voice to unite all of them in her service. When the Haunting started, Karmelita's voice was
                        capable of giving the Skarrs strength to resist it. As time went on, she grew old and her
                        strength faded, leaving the tribe vulnerable to the effects of the Haunting, though her fading
                        strength still offered them some protection.

                        Styx is located at the far east edge of the room at the lowest level of Sinner's Road.

                        Initially, there are 2 Muckroaches barking at the ceiling near Styx's location. After Hornet
                        defeats them, the room shakes and Styx descends from the ceiling. He assigns Hornet as his
                        mistress and vows to serve her.

                        After this point, he grows one Silkeater per hour that can be collected after they have grown.
                        Only one fully-grown Silkeater will be available at a time. 30 minutes after taking the
                        Silkeater he can be seen tending to a growing Silkeater cocoon.

                        If Styx is not in his nest, Hornet can call him back by playing the Needolin or pressing the
                        CHALLENGE button.

                        A delivery of a Queen's Egg from Bellhart to Styx can be given by Tipp & Pill. When this
                        delivery is completed, Styx's nest expands and allows him to hold up to 2 Silkeaters. This
                        delivery cannot be repeated.

                        In Act 3 Styx must be saved again from 2 Void Masses which appear in his room and also
                        temporarily disable the Bench. These Void Masses will replace the Muckroaches if this is
                        Hornet's first encounter with Styx.

                        In Steel Soul Mode, Styx is found dead in the collapsed remains of his nest. He is replaced by
                        Skynx who is found behind a breakable wall to the right of Styx's room.
