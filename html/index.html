        <p>Welcome to the Pharloom Encyclopedia, where I try to document
            as much as I can about <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>!

            Keep in mind, a lot of this information is being pulled off of the fan-made wiki, so some sections might be
            incomplete.

                    Hollow Knight: Silksong is the long-awaited sequel to the award-winning action-adventure Hollow
                    Knight.
                    Players
                    take on the role of Hornet, princess-protector of Hallownest, as she finds herself captured and
                    transported
                    to a
                    mysterious new kingdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Silksong, you’ll ascend through vast, haunting landscapes—from mossy grottos and shimmering coral
                    caves
                    to
                    gilded citadels—facing over 150 all-new enemies and deadly bosses. Hornet’s acrobatic combat and
                    silk-based
                    tools open up fast, fluid movement and a fresh style of play compared to the Knight of the original
                    game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The journey is not just about survival. You’ll uncover the secrets of this strange land, forge
                    unexpected
                    alliances, and unravel Hornet’s own tangled destiny. With hand-crafted art, atmospheric music, and
                    challenging
                    exploration, Hollow Knight: Silksong builds on everything fans loved about the first game while
                    pushing
                    into
                    uncharted territory.
