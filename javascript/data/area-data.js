Caution should be exercised with certain heat sources, as they are destructible and can render certain sections impassable without resetting. Mount Fay also has frigid waters that rapidly sap away Hornet's health as she swims through it. The Ascendant's Grip, Weavelight, Flintslate, and Plasmium Phial Tools can all make the trek easier, though they aren't required. At the top of Mount Fay, Hornet unlocks the Faydown Cloak, which grants her immunity to frostbite from its cold weather. However, icy water remains a threat to her health.",
